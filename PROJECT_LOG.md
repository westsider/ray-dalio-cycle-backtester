- `cycle_classifier.py` - Rule-based economic cycle classifier
- `example_usage.py` - Demo script with visualization
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Set up project structure with virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Configured FRED API key: `ebde2f9652163f7bc1694fa764f8ea44`
- ‚úÖ Implemented data fetcher for 10+ economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment, yield curve, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Built rule-based cycle classifier with 4 stages
- ‚úÖ Tested on historical data (2000-present)

**Current Model Performance:**
- Expansion: 67.6% of time
- Contraction: 16.3%
- Peak: 12.5%
- Recovery: 3.4%
- Current Stage (as of April 2025): **Expansion**

**Key Cycle Transitions Detected:**
- COVID crash: Jan 2020 (Expansion ‚Üí Contraction)
- Recovery: Aug 2020 (Contraction ‚Üí Expansion)
- 2022 volatility: Multiple transitions during inflation spike
- Current: Back to Expansion (April 2025)

### Phase 2: Backtesting Engine ‚úì (Completed 2025-10-22)

**Files Created:**
- `backtester.py` - Original backtesting framework
- `run_backtest.py` - Script to run original strategy
- `backtester_enhanced.py` - Enhanced backtester with improvements
- `run_backtest_enhanced.py` - Comparison script (Original vs Enhanced)
- `HOW_TO_RUN_BACKTEST.md` - User guide for running backtests

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Created full backtesting framework with position tracking
- ‚úÖ Implemented original strategy: Long SPY during Expansion only
- ‚úÖ Calculated comprehensive performance metrics:
  - Total return, Annual return
  - Sharpe ratio, Volatility
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Win rate, Average win/loss
- ‚úÖ Built comparison vs Buy & Hold SPY
- ‚úÖ Generated visualizations: equity curves, drawdowns, positions

**Original Strategy Results (2000-2025):**
- Total Return: **619.94%**
- Annual Return: 7.98%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.62
- Max Drawdown: -38.12%
- Total Trades: 17
- Win Rate: 70.6%

### Phase 3: Enhanced Strategy ‚úì (Completed 2025-10-22)

**Strategy Improvements Implemented:**
1. ‚úÖ **Peak Handling** - Stay invested during Peak (with 15% stop-loss)
2. ‚úÖ **Recovery Inclusion** - Enter during Recovery phase
3. ‚úÖ **Stop-Loss Protection** - Trailing stop-loss (20% Expansion, 15% Peak)
4. ‚úÖ **Smart Exits** - Only exit on Contraction or stop-loss trigger

**Enhanced Strategy Results (2000-2025):**
- Total Return: **964.01%** (+344% vs original!)
- Annual Return: 9.63%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.67
- Max Drawdown: -42.25%
- Total Trades: 11 (more efficient)
- Win Rate: 54.5%
- Stop-loss triggered: Only 2 times in 25 years

**Key Insights:**
- Enhanced strategy **significantly outperforms** both original and Buy & Hold
- Fewer trades but longer holding periods = better performance
- Stop-loss protection limited damage during crashes (2002, 2022)
- Staying in during Peak captured continued gains

### Phase 4: Web Application ‚úì (Completed 2025-10-22)

**Files Created:**
- `app.py` - Streamlit web application
- `RUN_WEB_APP.md` - Complete guide for using web app
- Updated `requirements.txt` - Added streamlit and plotly

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Interactive web dashboard (no command line needed!)
- ‚úÖ Click-button interface with dropdowns and sliders
- ‚úÖ Real-time data fetching from FRED and Yahoo Finance
- ‚úÖ Interactive Plotly charts (zoom, pan, hover)
- ‚úÖ Strategy comparison (Original vs Enhanced vs Buy & Hold)
- ‚úÖ Adjustable parameters:
  - Start date selection
  - Initial capital input
  - Stop-loss percentages (sliders)
  - Peak/Recovery toggle switches
- ‚úÖ Trade history display with color-coding
- ‚úÖ CSV download for trade data
- ‚úÖ Current cycle stage indicator
- ‚úÖ Data caching (1-hour) for performance

**Usage:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**Benefits:**
- No need to remember command line commands
- Easy weekly/monthly checks
- Experiment with settings instantly
- Visual, intuitive interface
- Perfect for non-technical users

## üìã Future Enhancement Ideas

### Phase 5: Strategy Refinements

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add confirmation signals (2-3 periods before entry/exit)
- [ ] Implement technical overlays (200-day MA, momentum)
- [ ] Multi-timeframe analysis (short-term vs long-term signals)
- [ ] Position sizing based on cycle confidence
- [ ] Options/hedging during Peak stages

### Phase 6: Multi-Asset Extension

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add bonds (TLT, IEF)
- [ ] Add gold (GLD)
- [ ] Add commodities (DBC)
- [ ] Test "All Weather" style rotations
- [ ] Compare different asset allocations per cycle stage

### Phase 7: Machine Learning (Optional)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Train ML classifier (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- [ ] Feature engineering from economic indicators
- [ ] Cross-validation for robustness
- [ ] Compare ML vs rule-based performance

## üîß Technical Setup

**Environment:**
- Python 3.x with virtual environment (`venv`)
- Location: `/Users/warrenhansen/Documents/RayDalioTests`

**Dependencies:**
- pandas, numpy
- yfinance (market data)

- matplotlib (static visualization)
- streamlit (web application)
- plotly (interactive charts)
- scikit-learn (future ML)

**Data Sources:**

- Yahoo Finance (SPY and other tickers)

---

## üìù Notes & Ideas

- Consider testing on different time periods (pre-2000 data if available)
- Explore transaction costs impact on strategy
- Add regime detection beyond 4 simple stages
- Consider international markets and global indicators
- Document key economic events that match cycle transitions
- Test different stop-loss percentages systematically
- Add email/SMS alerts when cycle stage changes
- Create automated weekly report generation

---

## üêõ Known Issues (Minor)

- Warning in `cycle_classifier.py:78`: `fillna(method='ffill')` deprecated - need to update to `.ffill()`
- Warning in `data_fetcher.py:71`: `pct_change(fill_method='pad')` deprecated
- Warnings are harmless but should be fixed for cleaner output
