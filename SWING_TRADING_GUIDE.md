# Swing Trading Strategy Guide

## Overview

The swing trading module extends your Ray Dalio Economic Cycle Backtester with intraday trading capabilities on 30-minute bars. It uses technical indicators to identify short-term pullbacks during favorable economic conditions.

## Features

### Data Source
- **Polygon.io API** for reliable 30-minute bar data
- Historical data available (free tier has some limitations on lookback period)
- SPY and QQQ supported out of the box
- Market hours filtering (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

### Technical Indicators

#### Bollinger Bands
- Default: 20-period SMA with 2 standard deviations
- Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- Entry signal when price drops below lower band

#### Keltner Channel
- Default: 20-period EMA with 2x ATR
- Alternative volatility-based channel
- Less sensitive to price spikes than Bollinger Bands

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Default: 14-period RSI
- Oversold threshold: 30 (entry signal)
- Overbought threshold: 70 (exit signal)
- Classic momentum oscillator

#### Additional Indicators
- **ATR (Average True Range)**: Volatility measurement
- **MACD**: Trend following indicator
- **Squeeze Indicator**: When Bollinger Bands contract inside Keltner Channel (low volatility setup)

### Entry Strategies

1. **BB + RSI** (Default)
   - Price < Lower Bollinger Band AND
   - RSI < 30 (oversold)
   - **Use case**: Mean reversion plays during pullbacks

2. **KC + RSI**
   - Price < Lower Keltner Channel AND
   - RSI < 30
   - **Use case**: More conservative entries using ATR-based bands

3. **Squeeze**
   - Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channel AND
   - RSI < 30 AND
   - Price < Lower BB
   - **Use case**: Low volatility breakout setups

### Exit Strategies

1. **BB Upper** (Default)
   - Exit when price crosses above upper Bollinger Band
   - **Use case**: Mean reversion target

2. **BB Middle**
   - Exit when price returns to middle band (20-period MA)
   - **Use case**: Conservative profit-taking

3. **RSI Overbought**
   - Exit when RSI > 70
   - **Use case**: Momentum-based exits

4. **KC Upper**
   - Exit when price crosses upper Keltner Channel
   - **Use case**: Volatility-based targets

### Risk Management

#### Stop Loss
- Default: 2% stop loss
- Always active to limit downside
- Adjustable from 0.5% to 10%

#### Profit Targets (Optional)
- Can be enabled with custom percentage
- Systematic profit-taking
- Useful for preventing "giving back" gains

#### Economic Filter (Optional)
- Only trade during Economic Expansion periods
- Combines macro regime with technical signals
- Helps avoid trading during recessions/contractions

## Optimization Tips

1. **Backtest Period**: Start with 90 days, then expand to validate
2. **RSI Thresholds**: Try 25/75 for stricter signals, 35/65 for more trades
3. **Stop Loss**: Tighter (1-2%) for mean reversion, wider (3-5%) for trends
4. **Bollinger Period**: Shorter (15) for more reactive, longer (25) for smoother
5. **Economic Filter**: Compare with/without to see impact of macro timing
